# program-chap05

Use the provided **URLDissector.java** as a starting point to create **FractionReader.java**. Instead of reading URL's, read fractions from the file  **fractions.txt**, one per line, add them to an **ArrayList**, and **print** them in **reverse** order with their values.

## Expected Output
```
110/50 = 2.2
99/98 = 1.010204081632653
1/5 = 0.2
7/8 = 0.875
2/3 = 0.6666666666666666
5/6 = 0.8333333333333334
21/7 = 3.0
3/4 = 0.75
```
## Recommended Phases
1. Change names:
   * Rename ```URLDissector``` to ```FractionReader``` (class name and file name).
   * Rename url and urlScan to be appropriately named for fractions.
   * Change ```urls.inp``` to ```fractions.txt```.
   * Update the comments to include your name, a description, and how this program went for you.
2. Add an ```ArrayList``` of ```Fractions```.
3. Remove the nested while loop and instead read 2 strings and convert them to integers, using ```Integer.parseInt(```*the value to convert*```);```
4. Create a ```Fraction``` object with the 2 integers and add it to the ```ArrayList```.
5. Add a loop to the end to print the fractions from the list in reverse order (elements size-1 to 0).
6. Remove any unnecesary prints and code.
